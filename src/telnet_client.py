Telnet Client Module

This module is responsible for establishing Telnet connections with grandMA2,
handling authentication, and sending commands. This is the only module in the
project permitted to directly manipulate Telnet.

According to coding-standards.md, the Telnet client is the only component that can:
- Open connections
- Execute login commands
- Perform reconnection logic
- Send raw MA commands

Uses telnetlib3 (based on asyncio) to replace the deprecated telnetlib module.

    grandMA2 Telnet Connection Client (Async Version)

    Provides Telnet connection management functionality for grandMA2 onPC/Console,
    including connection establishment, authentication, command sending, and
    reconnection logic.

    This version uses telnetlib3 and asyncio to avoid the deprecation of telnetlib
    in Python 3.13.

        host: grandMA2 host IP address
        port: Telnet port (default 30000, 30001 is read-only)
        user: Login username
        password: Login password

    Example (Async):
        >>> async with GMA2TelnetClient(host="192.168.1.100") as client:
        ...     await client.send_command("selfix fixture 1 thru 10")

    Example (Sync - using run_sync method):
        >>> client = GMA2TelnetClient(host="192.168.1.100")
        >>> client.run_sync(client.connect())
        >>> client.run_sync(client.login())
