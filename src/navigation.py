"""
grandMA2 Console Navigation Module

High-level async API for navigating the MA2 console's object tree via telnet.
Combines three layers:

1. Command builder (src/commands/functions/navigation.py) — generates cd strings
2. Telnet client (src/telnet_client.py) — sends commands, captures raw response
3. Prompt parser (src/prompt_parser.py) — extracts prompt state from raw output

Workflow for discovering console state:
  1. ``cd [object-type].[object-id]``  — navigate into an object
  2. ``list``                           — enumerate children at current destination
  3. Parse the list feedback to identify object-type, object-id, and element names

This module is the I/O boundary for navigation operations.
