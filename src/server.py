    This is an MCP server for controlling grandMA2 lighting console.
    You can use the following tools to operate grandMA2:

    1. create_fixture_group - Create a fixture group
       Example: Save fixtures 1 to 10 as group 1 with name "Front Wash"

    2. execute_sequence - Execute sequence operations
       Example: Execute sequence 1, pause sequence 2, jump to cue 5 of sequence 1

    3. send_raw_command - Send raw MA commands
       Example: Send "blackout" or "go+ executor 1.1"

    Send a raw MA command to grandMA2.

    WARNING: This is a low-level tool that sends commands directly to a LIVE
    lighting console. Prefer the higher-level tools (create_fixture_group,
    execute_sequence) whenever possible.

    SAFETY: Be extremely careful with destructive commands. The following
    command types can cause data loss or disrupt live shows:
    - delete / remove: Permanently removes show data (cues, groups, presets)
    - reset / restart / reboot / shutdown: Resets or shuts down the console
    - store with /overwrite: Overwrites existing show data
    - newshow / deleteshow: Creates or deletes entire shows
    - blackout: Kills all lighting output (disruptive during live events)

    Always double-check command syntax before sending. There is no undo for
    most destructive operations.

    Args:
        command: Raw MA command to send

    Returns:
        str: Operation result message
