    Create a new empty show (DESTRUCTIVE — replaces current show).

    CONNECTIVITY WARNING
    --------------------
    Creating a new show clears Global Settings, which **disables Telnet login**
    and severs the MCP connection.  ``preserve_connectivity=True`` (the default)
    automatically adds /globalsettings + /network + /protocols so Telnet stays
    enabled and network/DMX config is preserved.

    Set ``preserve_connectivity=False`` only if you intend to manually
    re-enable Telnet on the console afterwards (Setup → Console → Global
    Settings → Telnet → Login Enabled).

    Keep flags (correspond to un-checking "Clear …" in the MA2 New Show dialog):

    | Flag               | Dialog checkbox          | MA2 flag        | Included by preserve_connectivity |

    | keep_protocols     | Clear Network Protocols  | /protocols      | YES — Art-Net, sACN, etc.         |

        keep_timeconfig: Preserve Time Config from current show.
        keep_globalsettings: Preserve Global Settings (overrides preserve_connectivity).
        keep_localsettings: Preserve Local Settings from current show.

    AI assistant guidance
    ---------------------
    Always confirm ``preserve_connectivity=True`` unless the user explicitly
    wants a completely clean show AND understands Telnet will be disabled.
    Ask about keep_timeconfig, keep_localsettings, keep_user separately —
    these have no connectivity impact and are purely about preserving show data.

    This is the first step in the discover-names → derive-pattern → wildcard-command

    info(), label(), etc. by passing them as the ``name`` argument with
    ``match_mode="literal"`` (exact match) or deriving a ``*``-pattern and
    using ``match_mode="wildcard"``.

    CD scope covered
    ----------------
    Any destination accepted by navigate_console() works here:

# grandMA2 Busking Patterns

## Fader-Per-Effect Model
Each executor on a fader page runs one effect. The fader controls intensity
(0 = silent, 100 = full). Effects stay armed — zero fader silences, raise
fader restores. Never release effects mid-song; use normalize_page_faders.

Layout convention:
  - Column 1 (Exec 1): Song loader macro (first-button protocol)
  - Columns 2–8 (Exec 2–8): Effect faders (strobe, chase, color, beam...)
  - Columns 9–10: Group masters (intensity override for rig sections)
  - Fixed right page: Global effects that persist across songs

## Song Macro Page Protocol
Each song gets one page. Page name: `SNG_{n}_{SongName}` (e.g. SNG_3_Villains).

**First button (Exec 1) macro lines:**
1. `ClearAll` — reset programmer
2. `Go Preset 4.{palette_id}` — apply song color palette
3. `Go Macro {song_setup_macro}` — recall rig positions and timing
4. `SelectDrive {executor_page}` — jump to this song's effect page

**Remaining buttons:** effect executors — no macros, faders only.

## Live Recovery Protocol
When show state drifts (wrong levels, stuck effects):
1. `normalize_page_faders(page)` — zero all faders silently
2. `clear_effects_on_page(page)` — release stuck executors
3. Re-trigger song loader (Exec 1) to restore clean state
4. Gradually raise faders to rebuild look

## Color Lock Technique
Prevents color bleed when multiple effects are active:
1. Store song color as a Color preset (e.g. Preset 4.30 = deep amber)
2. Apply preset to all fixtures via Group masters before effects start
3. Effects modulate intensity/position only — color preset holds the hue
4. On song change: apply new color preset before raising new effect faders

    return """\
# grandMA2 Effect Design for Busking

## Effect Assignment
Use `assign_effect_to_executor(effect_id, executor_id, page=N)` to bind an
effect from the library to a fader slot. This is DESTRUCTIVE — do during
pre-show programming, not during live performance.

Command generated: `Assign Effect {id} Executor {id}` or `Assign Effect {id} Page {n}.{exec}`

After assignment, the fader controls the effect's master intensity (0-100).
The effect runs continuously while the executor is active.

## Rate vs Speed
| Parameter | Command | Semantics | Range |
|-----------|---------|-----------|-------|
| Rate | `EffectRate {n}` | Relative multiplier — 100 = normal | 1–200 |
| Speed | `EffectSpeed {n}` | Absolute BPM — overrides rate | 20–300 |

Use `modulate_effect(mode="rate", value=150)` to push effects 1.5× faster.
Use `modulate_effect(mode="speed", value=120)` to lock effects to 120 BPM.

Speed and rate affect the *selected* effects globally. To target a specific
executor's effect, select it first with `select_executor(executor_id)`.

## MAtricks Layering
Layer MAtricks patterns over effects for per-fixture phase offsets:
1. Select group, apply MAtricks Interleave
2. Run effect — each fixture gets a phase offset proportional to its index
3. Adjust interleave with `modulate_effect` rate to control chase tightness

## Batch Release Safety
`clear_effects_on_page(page, start_exec=1, end_exec=20)` sends 20 Off
commands in a single chained string. On slow consoles this may cause a
brief flash as effects die in sequence. To avoid: use `normalize_page_faders`
first (silences without visual glitch), then `clear_effects_on_page`.

| Parameter | Flag | Range | Notes |
|-----------|------|-------|-------|
| Hue | `/h=` | 0–360 | Degrees |
| Saturation | `/s=` | 0–100 | 0 = white, 100 = full color |
| Brightness | `/br=` | 0–100 | 0 = black, 100 = full |

Example: `store_preset 4.30 /h=30 /s=95 /br=100` = deep amber.

## Monochromatic Palette Strategy
Each song gets one hue with 4 brightness stops:
- Stop 1: Full intensity (br=100, s=90)
- Stop 2: Mid punch (br=70, s=85)
- Stop 3: Moody fill (br=40, s=80)
- Stop 4: Near-black accent (br=15, s=75)

## Preset Numbering Convention
`preset_id = song_id * 10 + stop_index`

| Song | Stop | Preset |
|------|------|--------|
| Song 1 | 1 (full) | 11 |
| Song 1 | 2 (mid) | 12 |
| Song 3 | 4 (accent) | 34 |

Recall with `apply_preset(preset_type="color", preset_id=34)`.

## Color Lock Technique
1. Before raising effect faders, apply the song's full-intensity color preset
   to all rig fixtures via group masters: `group_at(group_id=99, value=100)`
2. Effects that only modulate intensity/position inherit the locked color
3. Transition between songs: apply new color preset (step 1) BEFORE releasing
   the previous song's effect faders — avoids white flash on crossover
4. For fixtures with separate color channels (CMY movers): store color in a
   Color preset, not in the programmer, so it survives `ClearAll`

# GrandPA2-Buddy Volunteer Operator Guide

## The Three Safety Tiers

GrandPA2-Buddy enforces three access levels automatically. You cannot accidentally break something outside your tier.

| Your Role | Tier | What You Can Do |
|-----------|------|-----------------|
| New volunteer | SAFE_READ | See console state, verify the show is correct. Zero risk. |
| Trained operator | SAFE_WRITE | Trigger go/pause, adjust faders, apply presets. With guidance. |
| Technical Director | DESTRUCTIVE | Store cues, modify show file, change patch. TD only. |

## Sunday Morning Preflight (Any Volunteer -- SAFE_READ)

Run in order before doors open:

1. Verify show file -- get_showfile_info() -- confirm show name matches expected
2. Check for changes -- assert_showfile_unchanged() -- if this fails, STOP and call TD
3. Hydrate -- hydrate_console_state() -- snapshot everything
4. Check presets -- list_preset_pool(preset_type="color") -- should have entries
5. Check executors -- get_executor_detail(executor_id="1.1") -- confirm sequence assigned
6. Check cues -- query_object_list(object_type="sequence", object_id=1) -- confirm cues present

All GREEN? You are ready. Any RED? Call your TD before service.

## During Service (Trained Volunteer -- SAFE_WRITE)

- Advance cues: playback_action(executor_id, action="go")
- Pause: playback_action(executor_id, action="pause")
- Jump to cue: goto_cue(executor_id, cue_id)

## When Things Go Wrong

| Problem | Action |
|---------|--------|
| Wrong look on stage | Do NOT touch anything. Note cue number. Call TD. |
| Console unresponsive | Run get_console_location(). If error, notify TD. |
| Show file looks different | Run assert_showfile_unchanged(). If fails, STOP, call TD immediately. |
| Executor shows wrong state | Run get_executor_detail(executor_id) and report to TD. |

Rule: If in doubt, do nothing and call your TD.

# SB 132 Compliance Guide for GrandPA2-Buddy

## What SB 132 Requires (July 2025)

California SB 132 applies to productions receiving the CA Film & Television Tax Credit and requires:

1. Dedicated Safety Advisor -- on set daily
2. Written Risk Assessment -- before any high-risk operation
3. Daily Safety Meeting Notes -- documented
4. Final Safety Report -- within 60 days of wrap

## GrandPA2-Buddy Data to SB 132 Mapping

| SB 132 Requirement | GrandPA2-Buddy Source | Tool |
|---|---|---|
| Written risk assessment | risk_tier per operation (SAFE_READ/SAFE_WRITE/DESTRUCTIVE) | get_telemetry_report() |
| Operator identification | operator field in tool_invocations | get_telemetry_report() |
| Daily safety meeting notes | session_id grouped timeline with timestamps | generate_compliance_report() |
| Incident log | error_class field in tool_invocations | get_telemetry_report(risk_tier="DESTRUCTIVE") |
| Final safety report | Full session export | generate_compliance_report(session_id=...) |

## Three-Tier Risk Stratification (for Insurance Underwriters)

GrandPA2-Buddy classifies every lighting control operation:

- SAFE_READ -- Read-only monitoring. Zero risk to console state or physical hardware.
- SAFE_WRITE -- Controlled modifications (level adjustments, go/pause). Standard operational risk.
- DESTRUCTIVE -- High-risk operations (cue storage, show file changes, patch modifications).
  Requires explicit confirm_destructive=True AND elevated OAuth scope. All logged.

## Generating a Compliance Report

Use generate_compliance_report(session_id, production_name, operator_name, days=1)
for a markdown report ready for safety documentation.

Use get_telemetry_report(session_id, format="json") for archival JSON export.

## Insurance Brief Template

All lighting control operations during [PRODUCTION NAME] were processed through
GrandPA2-Buddy's three-tier safety system. [N] operations were classified SAFE_READ
(read-only monitoring, zero risk), [M] were SAFE_WRITE (controlled modifications
requiring standard authorization), and [K] were DESTRUCTIVE (required explicit
authorization and elevated scope). Full telemetry is retained for forensic review
and available upon request from the production safety advisor.

## IATSE Kit Rental

Under the 2024 IATSE-AMPTP contract, AI tools used by union members constitute "covered work"
and operators may charge a kit rental fee. GrandPA2-Buddy's operator field in telemetry
records which union member ran each session, supporting kit rental documentation.

# RDM Workflow Reference

## What is RDM?

RDM (Remote Device Management) is a bidirectional extension to DMX512 (ANSI E1.20)
that allows a lighting console to identify, configure, and report status from
intelligent fixtures without additional cabling.

## When to Use RDM

| Use Case | RDM Benefit |
|----------|------------|
| Unknown rig | Identify all fixtures and their current DMX addresses |
| Address conflicts | Read device-reported addresses vs. patch sheet |
| Fixture status | Get lamp hours, temperature, error status |
| Autopatch | Let MA2 suggest addresses based on discovered footprints |

## Tool Sequence

1. Discover all RDM devices on a universe: rdm_discover(universe_id=1)
   Returns: list of {uid, manufacturer, device_model, footprint, current_address}

2. Get detailed info for a specific device: rdm_get_info(uid="0x1234567890AB")
   Returns: full device profile including label, DMX footprint, current address, error status

3. Apply a DMX address (autopatch): rdm_patch(uid="0x1234567890AB", target_address=1, confirm_destructive=True)
   Assigns the fixture to channel 1 on its universe

## Limitations

- Not all fixtures support RDM. Most intelligent fixtures do; dimmers may not.
- RDM requires a proper terminator at the end of the DMX chain.
- RDM discovery can take 10-30 seconds per universe on large rigs.
- After RDM patch, verify with list_fixtures() and detect_dmx_address_conflicts().

## RDM vs Manual Patching

| | RDM | Manual |
|---|---|---|
| Speed | Fast for large rigs | Faster for small rigs |
| Accuracy | Device-reported | Human-verified |
| Risk | Overwrites existing addresses | You control every address |
| Recommended when | Unknown rental rig, >50 fixtures | Known rig, <20 fixtures |

# grandMA2 Lua Scripting Reference

## Environment

grandMA2 uses Lua 5.2 with the gma.* namespace for console integration.
Standard Lua libraries (math, string, table, io) are available.

## Core gma.* Functions

| Function | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| gma.cmd(str) | Execute a MA2 command |
| gma.echo(str) | Print to feedback line |
| gma.show.getvar(name) | Read show variable |
| gma.show.setvar(name, val) | Write show variable |
| gma.user.confirm(msg) | Show OK/Cancel dialog |
| gma.timer.sleep(ms) | Pause execution (ms) |
| gma.gui.confirm(title, msg) | GUI confirmation |

## Plugin vs Macro: Decision Guide

| Need | Use |
|------|-----|
| Simple linear commands | Macro (MA2 command strings) |
| Loop (for/while) | Lua Plugin |
| Math calculation | Lua Plugin |
| Read/write variables | Either (SetVar in macro, gma.show.setvar in Lua) |
| User dialog (confirm/input) | Lua Plugin only |
| Conditional (if/else) | Lua Plugin |

## Common Patterns

Loop over fixture IDs:
  for i = 1, 20 do
      gma.cmd("Fixture " .. i .. " At 100")
      gma.timer.sleep(100)
  end

Read and branch on system variable:
  local pg = tonumber(gma.show.getvar("FADERPAGE"))
  if pg == 1 then gma.cmd("Page 2") else gma.cmd("Page 1") end

User confirmation gate:
  if gma.user.confirm("Delete all cues in Sequence 99?") then
      gma.cmd("Delete Cue 1 Thru 999 Sequence 99")
      gma.echo("Cues deleted.")
  else
      gma.echo("Cancelled.")
  end

## MCP Integration

Use run_lua_script(script_body) to execute inline Lua via MCP.
Use call_plugin_tool(plugin_name, args) to invoke a saved plugin by name.
Use reload_all_plugins() after uploading a new .lua file via USB.

Safety note: Lua scripts executed via gma.cmd() bypass MCP's safety gate.
Ensure scripts that call DESTRUCTIVE commands (Store, Delete, Assign) include
appropriate confirmations via gma.user.confirm().

Execute the following SAFE_READ verification sequence in order. Stop and report
immediately if any step returns unexpected results.

STEP 1 -- SHOWFILE VERIFICATION
Call get_showfile_info(). Confirm the show name matches "{show_name or 'the expected show name'}".
Then call assert_showfile_unchanged(). If it returns False, STOP -- the show file has been modified
since the last programmer session. Do not proceed; contact the Technical Director.

STEP 2 -- STATE HYDRATION
Call hydrate_console_state(). Then call get_console_state().
Check for: unexpected parked fixtures (park_ledger not empty), active filter (may restrict fixtures),
unexpected world assignment.

STEP 3 -- PRESET POOL CHECK
Call list_preset_pool(preset_type="color") and list_preset_pool(preset_type="position").
Flag as AMBER if either pool has fewer than 3 entries.

STEP 4 -- EXECUTOR ASSIGNMENT CHECK
Call get_executor_detail(executor_id="1.1") and get_executor_detail(executor_id="1.2").
Confirm each has a sequence assigned and at least 1 cue.

STEP 5 -- CUE INTEGRITY CHECK
Call query_object_list(object_type="sequence", object_id=1).
Confirm the expected number of cues are present and the first cue is labeled.

STEP 6 -- GENERATE REPORT
Return a structured report:

Target executor page: {target_page}
Fixture grouping strategy: {fixture_strategy} (options: by_type, by_position, by_zone)

PHASE 0 -- SURVEY (SAFE_READ, always first -- present findings before proceeding)
1. Call hydrate_console_state() and list_fixtures() -- record total fixture count and types
2. Call list_fixture_types() -- identify unique fixture types in the rig
3. Call list_preset_pool(preset_type="color") -- check if color presets already exist
4. Call list_preset_pool(preset_type="position") -- check position presets
5. Present survey summary to operator and ask: "I found [N] fixtures of [M] types.
   Color pool has [K] existing presets. Shall I proceed with template generation?"
   STOP if operator says no.

PHASE 1 -- GROUP CREATION (confirm before executing DESTRUCTIVE operations)
Using the {fixture_strategy} strategy:
- by_type: one group per fixture type (all washes, all spots, all beams, all strobes)
- by_position: groups by stage position (front, back, left, right, truss)
- by_zone: groups by zone (audience, stage, backlight)

For each group: call create_fixture_group() then label_or_appearance() with HSB color coding.
Ask operator to confirm before executing: "I will create [N] groups in slots [X-Y]. Proceed?"

PHASE 2 -- COLOR PRESETS (8 per group -- confirm first)
Create 8 universal color presets using RGB 0-100 scale:
Red(100,0,0), Orange(100,40,0), Yellow(100,100,0), Green(0,100,0),
Cyan(0,100,100), Blue(0,0,100), Magenta(100,0,100), White(100,100,100)

PHASE 3 -- POSITION PRESETS (movers only -- 4 positions)
For fixture groups with Pan/Tilt attributes: create Home, DownCenter, SL_Top, SR_Top presets.

PHASE 4 -- EXECUTOR LAYOUT (confirm slot assignments before executing)
On page {target_page}:
- Exec 1: Song loader macro (label "LOAD")
- Exec 2-5: Effect sequences per fixture group
- Exec 6-8: Group intensity masters
- Exec 9: Speed master 1 (default 120 BPM)
- Exec 10: Emergency blackout macro

PHASE 5 -- VERIFY AND SAVE
Call get_console_state() to confirm all objects registered.
Call save_show(confirm_destructive=True) -- always save after template build.

At each DESTRUCTIVE phase, pause and confirm with the operator before proceeding.
Never auto-execute DESTRUCTIVE operations without explicit operator confirmation."""

"Current rig has [N] fixtures of types [A, B, C].
[Describe any type mismatches based on new_venue_notes].
Which types map to which in the new venue?"

WAIT for operator confirmation of the fixture type mapping before proceeding.

PHASE 1 -- IDENTIFY MISMATCHES
Cross-reference fixture types in the show against new venue patch.
Categorize each type as: COMPATIBLE (same attributes), SIMILAR (same Pan/Tilt/Dim but different gobos),
or INCOMPATIBLE (completely different attribute set).

DECISION: If >50% of fixture types are INCOMPATIBLE, recommend using generate_busking_template
prompt to rebuild from scratch rather than adapting.

PHASE 2 -- REMAP GROUPS (confirm before DESTRUCTIVE operations)
For each group containing old fixture IDs:
  Check current membership with query_object_list(object_type="group", object_id=N).
  If fixture type mapping is COMPATIBLE or SIMILAR: use remap_fixture_ids() to update
  group membership with new fixture IDs. Ask operator to confirm before each group.

PHASE 3 -- VERIFY PRESETS
For SIMILAR types: test universal color presets -- call apply_preset(preset_type="color", preset_id=1)
with new fixture selected and verify output.
For INCOMPATIBLE types: presets must be re-recorded. Guide operator through re-recording.

PHASE 4 -- TEST AND VERIFY
Select a sample group: select_fixtures_by_group(group_id=1).
Apply a color preset: apply_preset(preset_type="color", preset_id=1).
Confirm correct fixtures respond.

PHASE 5 -- SAVE
Call save_show(confirm_destructive=True).

At every DESTRUCTIVE phase: present what will change and ask "Proceed? (yes/no)" before executing."""
